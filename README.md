# How to install a CFW onto RPCS3.

Here are the steps for installing a custom firmware for RPCS3. *Remember that this is version 4.84.1 of the PS3 firmware, NOT the latest version. It will work fine though.*
1. Open RPCS3.
2. Once RPCS3 is installed and ready to go, navigate to the top left menu and select "Install Firmware"
3. Use a CFW PS3UPDAT.PUP file installs the firmware. In this case, we will use REBUG 4.84.1. You can download it from [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/1xc2fedz92suvp7/PS3UPDAT.PUP/file).
4. Place the downloaded PUP file into a folder and install it through the options given in RPCS3. That's all. Just try booting up the emulator and it should install a ton of stuff.

Once all of these steps are finished, you can start installing whatever you'd like.
